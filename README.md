## Exploring Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

### Introduction

At the start of summer 2019 I heard about and became interested in topics of data structures & algorithms. I knew this was going to be a class I would end up taking in the future but I wanted to teach myself prior. So I start reading  [Data Structures & Algorithms in Java, Second Edition](http://web.fi.uba.ar/~jvillca/hd/public/books/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_in_Java_2nd_Edition.pdf) by Robert Lafore. I went through each chapter and solved as many assigned projects as I could. By the end of the summer I had covered 95% of the textbook, so the next step was to create a website showcasing and teaching these projects.

### What I Learned

* Used React functional and class components to structure the user-interface.
* Implemented the front-end and back-end of a contact form/page using the Node.js runtime environment.
* Used HTML5 grids and CSS3 to structure each and style every page on the site from scratch (no Bootstrap).
